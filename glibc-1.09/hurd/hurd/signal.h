/* Do an RPC to a process's message port.

   Each argument is an expression which returns an error code; each
   expression may be evaluated several times.  FETCH_MSGPORT_EXPR should
   fetch the appropriate message port and store it in the local variable
   `msgport'.  FETCH_REFPORT_EXPR should fetch the appropriate message port
   and store it in the local variable `refport' (if no reference port is
   needed in the call, then FETCH_REFPORT_EXPR should be simply
   KERN_SUCCESS or 0).  Both of these are assumed to create user
   references, which this macro deallocates.  RPC_EXPR should perform the
   desired RPC operation using `msgport' and `refport'.

   The reason for the complexity is that a process's message port and
   reference port may change between fetching those ports and completing an
   RPC using them (usually they change only when a process execs).  The RPC
   will fail with MACH_SEND_INVALID_DEST if the msgport dies before we can
   send the RPC request; or with MIG_SERVER_DIED if the msgport was
   destroyed after we sent the RPC request but before it was serviced.  In
   either of these cases, we retry the entire operation, discarding the old
   message and reference ports and fetch them anew.  */
