This directory contains the version 1.09 test release of the GNU C Library.
Many bugs have been fixed since the last release.
Some bugs surely remain.

As of this release, the GNU C library has been ported to the following
configurations:

		alpha-dec-osf1
		i386-bsd4.3
		i386-force_cpu386-none
		i386-gnu (for Hurd development only)
		i386-isc2.2
		i386-isc3
		i386-sco3.2
		i386-sco3.2v4
		i386-sequent-bsd
		i386-sysv
		i386-sysv4
		i960-nindy960-none
		m68k-hp-bsd4.3
		m68k-mvme135-none
		m68k-mvme136-none
		m68k-sony-newsos3
		m68k-sony-newsos4
		m68k-sun-sunos4
		mips-dec-ultrix4
		mips-sgi-irix4
		sparc-sun-solaris2
		sparc-sun-sunos4

Porting the library is not hard.  If you are interested in doing a port,
please get on the mailing list by sending electronic mail to
bug-glibc-request@prep.ai.mit.edu.

The GNU C library now includes Michael Glad's Ultra Fast Crypt, which
provides the Unix `crypt' function, plus some other entry points.
Because of the United States export restriction on DES implementations,
we are distributing this code separately from the rest of the C
library.  There is an extra distribution tar file just for crypt; it is
called `glibc-1.09-crypt.tar.gz'.  You can just unpack the crypt
distribution along with the rest of the C library and build; you can
also build the library without getting crypt.  Users outside the USA
can get the crypt distribution via anonymous FTP from ftp.uni-c.dk
[129.142.6.74], or another archive site outside the USA.  Archive
maintainers are encouraged to copy this distribution to their archives
outside the USA.  Please get it from ftp.uni-c.dk; transferring this
distribution from prep.ai.mit.edu (or any other site in the USA) to a
site outside the USA is in violation of US export laws.

See the file INSTALL to find out how to configure, build, install, and port
the GNU C library.

The GNU C Library is completely documented by the Texinfo manual found
in the `manual/' subdirectory.  The manual is still being updated and
contains some known errors and omissions; we regret that we do not have
the resources to work on the manual as much as we would like.  Please
send comments on the manual to bug-glibc-manual@prep.ai.mit.edu, and
not to the library bug-reporting address.

The file NOTES contains a description of the feature-test macros used
in the GNU C library, explaining how you can tell the library what
facilities you want it to make available.

Send bug reports to bug-glibc@prep.ai.mit.edu.

The GNU C Library is free software.  See the file COPYING.LIB for copying
conditions.
