/* These are bit masks and shift counts to use to access the various
   fields of an instruction.  To retrieve the X field of an
   instruction, use the expression
	(i >> OP_SH_X) & OP_MASK_X
   To set the same field (to j), use
	i = (i &~ (OP_MASK_X << OP_SH_X)) | (j << OP_SH_X)

   Make sure you use fields that are appropriate for the instruction,
   of course.  

   The 'i' format uses OP, RS, RT and IMMEDIATE.  

   The 'j' format uses OP and TARGET.

   The 'r' format uses OP, RS, RT, RD, SHAMT and FUNCT.

   The 'b' format uses OP, RS, RT and DELTA.

   The floating point 'i' format uses OP, RS, RT and IMMEDIATE.

   The floating point 'r' format uses OP, FMT, FT, FS, FD and FUNCT.

   A breakpoint instruction uses OP, CODE and SPEC (10 bits of the
   breakpoint instruction are not defined; Kane says the breakpoint
   code field in BREAK is 20 bits; yet MIPS assemblers and debuggers
   only use ten bits).

   The syscall instruction uses SYSCALL.

   The general coprocessor instructions use COPZ.  */
